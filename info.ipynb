I applied anomaly detection algorithms — Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor — to learn the pattern of normal transactions and flag anomalies. Despite only 0.172% of data being fraud, I achieved 99.7% accuracy and a recall of 0.53, demonstrating the ability to detect fraud in real-world, noisy datasets.”\n",

Isolation Forest detected 25% of frauds using unsupervised learning, which was impressive given no training labels. However, Local Outlier Factor failed to generalize, highlighting how algorithm choice and scalability matter in real-world imbalanced datasets.\"\n",

    "I used Isolation Forest to detect fraud in a highly imbalanced dataset. It builds random trees to isolate data points — the fewer splits a point needs, the more likely it’s an anomaly. My model flagged about 25% of the real frauds with zero labeled training, which is a solid result in unsupervised fraud detection. I evaluated using precision and recall instead of accuracy to avoid being misled by the imbalance.\n"
